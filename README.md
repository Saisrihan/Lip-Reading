INTRODUCTION
This project aims to develop a lip reading system using deep learning techniques.
Lip reading, also known as speechreading, is the process of understanding speech by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face, and tongue without relying on sound.
PROJECT STRUCTURE 
Contains datasets used for training and testing the lip reading models.
Stores pre-trained models and trained models generated during the training process.
